<p><strong>Author:</strong> Frans de Waal<br />
<strong>Whispersync for Voice:</strong> Ready<br />
<strong>Audible.co.uk Release Date:</strong> 25 April 2016  </p>
<p>Frans de Waal, a world-renowned biologist and primatologist, challenges our understanding of animal intelligence in this groundbreaking work. De Waal argues that the traditional viewpoint of human superiority in cognition is outdated. Through research on a variety of animals, from octopuses using tools to elephants recognizing human characteristics and a chimpanzee's extraordinary memory, he showcases the remarkable cognitive abilities of the animal kingdom. De Waal suggests that intelligence may not be a hierarchical ladder with humans at the top but rather a bush with various forms of cognition. This book is a call to reassess not only how we view animal intelligence but also the very definition of intelligence itself.</p>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Daniel Kahneman<br />
<strong>Narrator:</strong> Patrick Egan<br />
<strong>Audible.co.uk Release Date:</strong> 23 December 2011  </p>
<p>In "Thinking, Fast and Slow," Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman introduces a fascinating tour of the mind, delineating the two distinct systems that affect how we think and make decisions.

From how we perceive risk and others to our susceptibility to cognitive biases, Kahneman's insights challenge our understanding of rationality. He explains the benefits of slow thinking and how to mitigate the pitfalls of fast judgements, providing a comprehensive guide to making better decisions in our personal and professional lives. "Thinking, Fast and Slow" is not only an exploration of human cognition but also a manual for understanding and improving our decision-making processes, offering profound insights on how to navigate the complexities of the mind.</p>
